        <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                The purpose of Lab 5 was to control the RC car using the Artemis directly,
                using the newly added dual motor drivers. By the end of the lab, the car can
                execute a set of pre-programmed moves including turns.
            </p>

        <h1>Prelab</h1>
            <p>
                Before coming to the lab, there were a few things to consider. Firstly, I considered
                the pins that I would use to connect the motor drivers to. Given that they require
                PWM signals, the pin would have to be labeled with a "~" in the datasheet. Also,
                taking into consideration how they would be oriented to allow for easier 
                connections, I decided to connect the motor drivers as can be seen in the image
                below, where the left and right motor drivers are on either side of the Artemis
                board.
            </p>
            <figure id="figure1">
                <img src="/ece4160-website/assets/images/lab5/wiring.jpg"
                alt="Connection of motor drivers to Artemis">
            </figure>
            
            <p>
                For the left motor, I decided to connect <samp>IN1</samp> and <samp>IN2</samp> to
                A15 and A16, respectively. For the right motor, I decided to connect them to A1 and
                A0, respectively. The <samp>OUT1</samp> for both drivers would be connected to the
                negative of the motor and the <samp>OUT2</samp> to the positive. Finally, all of
                the grounds would be connected, ensuring common ground among all, and the
                <samp>VIN</samp> for both drivers would be connected to the motor battery's
                positive.
            </p>

            <p>
                Additionally, the Artemis and the motor drivers are to be powered using different
                batteries. This is because the motors connected to the motor drivers draw a lot of
                current, while the Artemis does not. Hence, the 850mAh battery is used for the motor
                drivers, and the 650mAh battery is used for the Artemis.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, the last consideration was for routing the variety of wires. As seen in
                <a href="/ece4160-website/labs/lab5.html#figure1">Figure 1</a>,
                there are about 13 wires that need to be long enough to reach other components.
                Given the scope of this lab, I decided that it would be fine to have long wires, as
                long as they are not unnecessarily long to cause considerable noise, as it would
                make the connections easier, and there would be no requirement to desolder and
                resolder the wires in the case of a wire not reaching a component. Also, taking
                inspiration from
                <a href="https://anyafp.github.io/ece4960/labs/lab5/#prelab">Anya's report</a>,
                I decided to twist the wires with each other to cancel out the positive and negative
                magnetic fields. Furthermore, given that solid core wires can cause problems when
                undergoing high accelerations, I decided to use stranded wire for all connections.
            </p>

        <h1>Lab Tasks</h1>
            <h2>First Dual Motor Driver</h2>
                <p>
                    I started by soldering all of the wires to the motor driver. After soldering,
                    here is what it looked like.
                </p>
                <figure id="figure2">
                    <img src="/ece4160-website/assets/images/lab5/motordriver1.jpg"
                    alt="Wires soldered to motor driver">
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, due to timing constraints, I was unable to go to the lab to take
                    oscilloscope measurements for the PWM signals. However, if I were to have had
                    time, I would have chosen the power supply voltage to be 3.7V, as this is equal
                    to the voltage output of the motor battery, and current to be 2A, to be well
                    below the maximum rating.
                </p>
            
            <h2><samp>analogWrite</samp></h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, I was unable to go to lab to get the oscilloscope
                    measurements. However, taking a look at my classmates reports, it seems that
                    the waveform for a 50% duty cycle signal has the following shape.
                </p>

            <h2>Taking the Car Apart</h2>
                <p>
                    The next step was to take apart the RC car and connect one of its motors to the
                    motor driver. After connecting the motor driver to the motor, the RC car looks
                    like the following.

            <h2>Powering Motor Drivers with 850mAh Battery</h2>
                <p>
                    Since I was unable to go to the lab, I have already been using the 850mAh
                    battery to power the motor drivers. I made sure to connect the positive and
                    negative terminals coorectly, and there were no issues so far.
