        <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                The purpose of Lab 2 was to set up a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
                communication between the Artermis Nano and the computer. The
                computer would interface with the board by sending and receiving
                data from a Python program in a Jupyter Notebook to an Arduino
                program.
            </p>

        <h1>Prelab</h1>
            <h2>Setup</h2>
                <p>
                    I first updated Python and pip to the latest versions, and
                    installed a Python virtual environment (<samp>venv</samp>).
                    A virtual environment allows for the installation of Python
                    packages that is separate from other environments and the main
                    Python installation. This way, the specific environment can have
                    specific versions of packages that might otherwise conflict with
                    the other environments. Then, after installing a few Python
                    packages on the virtual environment, I flashed the Artermis
                    with the Arduino Bluetooth sketch, causing it to print the board's
                    MAC address to the Serial Monitor as can be seen below.
                </p>

                <figure id="figure1">
                    <img src="/ece4160-website/assets/images/lab2/macaddress.jpg"
                        alt="MAC Address of my Artemis Nano">
                </figure>

            <h2>Codebase</h2>
                <p>
                    The codebase is separated between Python and Arduino. The
                    Python code consists of various modules responsible for 
                    establishing a Bluetooth connection to the Artermis, defining
                    an enumeration of command types, creating a method to print
                    outputs in a comprehensible manner (by including timestamp,
                    color-coding the information, etc.), and assisting with
                    debugging using log messages. The main file utilizing these
                    modules is the Jupyter Notebook file <samp>demo.ipynb</samp>.
                    The notebook incrementally generates a UUID, establishes a
                    BLE connection, receives data from the Artemis as
                    programmed initially on the Arduino sketch described below,
                    sends commands to the Artemis and prints out the response,
                    and finally disconnects the BLE connection, each step
                    generating an output that is easily readable by the user
                    with the ability to only run each section with memory of the
                    previous sections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Arduino code handles the data sent to the Artemis via
                    Bluetooth from the Jupyter Notebook depending on the type of
                    command. The command establishes an expected set (or lack) of
                    arguments which, for example, can be pretty-printed to the
                    Serial Monitor. Also, some commands are handled by sending
                    back some specific data such as a timestamp or processor
                    temperature back to the notebook. Additionally, there are
                    C++ header files defining helper modules for the Arduino
                    code such as an enhanced String class with added functionality
                    on top of a String, and a specifc type of String that is sent
                    via Bluetooth by the Bluetooth module.
                </p>

        <h1>Lab Tasks</h1>
            <h2>Configurations</h2>
                <p>
                    After obtaining the MAC address, I updated the appropriate 
                    value in <samp>connections.yaml</samp>. Then, I generated a
                    new UUID in the notebook and replaced the value in the
                    Arduino code as well as in the same yaml file. Finally,
                    to ensure that the bluetooth connection would be established
                    on my Windows computer, I changed
                    <pre>if IS_ATLEAST_MAC_OS_12:</pre>
                    to
                    <pre>if True:</pre>
                    Unfortunately, this did not work, and I ended up using the
                    former condition in the if statement for a successful
                    connection.
                </p>

            <h2>Jupyter Notebook <samp>demo.ipynb</samp></h2>
                <p>
                    The next step was to test that the BLE connection worked
                    by flashing the Arduino sketch to the board and running
                    the notebook cells that performed the aforementioned set
                    of incremental steps. As can be seen below, I successfully
                    established a BLE connection.
                </p>
                <figure id="figure2">
                    <img src="/ece4160-website/assets/images/lab2/connected.jpg"
                    alt="BLE connected established on Arduino">
                    <img src="/ece4160-website/assets/images/lab2/BTConnected.jpg"

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Then, I ran the cell sending the "PING" command to the
                    Artemis and received a "PONG" back. In the next cell, the
                    notebook sent the "SEND_TWO_INTS" command with "2|-6" as
                    the arguments. The Arduino code parsed the arguments and
                    pretty printed them to the Serial Monitor. Both of these can
                    be seen in the images below.
                </p>
                <figure id="figure3">

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Finally, I ran the disconnect cell and the Bluetooth
                    connection was terminated.
                </p>

            <h2>Send Echo</h2>
                <p>
                    This task required sending an <samp>ECHO</samp> command with
                    a String as an argument from the notebook to the Artemis and
                    receiving back the same string with more characters prepended and
                    appended to it. On the Python side, I wrote a function that
                    would send the command with a parameterized value and print
                    the response:
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/sg758/584ad8f49e9b359c878e06c3f57a9168.js"></script>
                <p>
                    On the Arduino side, I added the following handler code in
                    the case where the <samp>ECHO</samp> command was received:
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/sg758/73c8f6b00d9222c18df957a5610425c9.js"></script>
                <p>
                    Invoking the function with argument <samp>"Command 1"</samp>
                    resulted in the following response:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <samp>Artemis Robot Says: "Command 1" :D</samp>
                </p>
            
            <h2>Get Time</h2>
                <p>
                    This task required adding a new command type
                    <samp>GET_TIME_MILLIS</samp>, sending which to the board
                    would cause it to reply with the current time in milliseconds
                    formatted as "T:xxxxx" in accordance with the String
                    characteristic type. On the Python side, I wrote a similar
                    function that would send the command and print the response:
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/sg758/dccc6a273e4b8d33575b020294c183bd.js"></script>
                <p>
                    On the Arduino side, I added the following handler code in
                    the case where the <samp>GET_TIME_MILLIS</samp> command was
                    received:
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/sg758/10b2838d04a3ed484ea51bc60d550296.js"></script>
                <p>
                    Invoking the function resulted in the following response:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <samp>T:424303</samp>
                </p>
            
            <h2>Notification Handler</h2>
                <p>
                    This task required setting up a notification handler in Python
                    to receive any string value. This would essentially serve
                    as an event listener for the receive string event, and
                    invoke a callback function. The callback function converted
                    the bytearray to a string and printed it. The Python code
                    can be seen below.
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/sg758/1b4b5d7a4674b063712135b2e9833f03.js"></script>
                <p>
                    I invoked the notification handler by sending a
                    <samp>GET_TIME_MILLIS</samp> command, whose response was
                    sent to the callback function and printed as a String to the
                    output:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <samp>T:428983</samp>
                </p>
            
            <h2>Get Temperature</h2>
                <p>
                    This task required adding a new command
                    <samp>GET_TEMP_5s</samp>, whose receipt on the Arduino side
                    would trigger the handler code to send back an array of
                    five timestamped processor temperature readings, each taken
                    every second for 5s upon receipt. The Python code for this
                    can be seen below.
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/sg758/9b7b16e628a84b5e61311490886b149f.js"></script>
                <p>
                    Evidently, I reused the same callback function to print
                    the response from the Artemis. On the Arduino code side,
                    I added the new command type and added handler code as
                    follows:
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/sg758/96db9970a31cfea05b563c78416e89d1.js"></script>
                <p>
                    As evident from the code, I sent each characteristic string
                    after one pair of timestamp and temperature reading as so
                    to prevent going over the maximum character limit. Invoking
                    the Python function caused the following response to be
                    printed:
                </p>
                <figure id="figure5">
                    <img src="/ece4160-website/assets/images/lab2/temp5s.jpg"
                        alt="5 seconds of temperature data">
                </figure>
            
            <h2>Get Temperature Rapid</h2>
                <p>
                    Similar to the previous task, this task required adding the
                    <samp>GET_TEMP_5s_RAPID</samp> command, which would send
                    back every temperature reading over a 5 second period,
                    without a 1 second delay as before. The Python code for this
                    can be seen below.
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/sg758/31a9e16faf7c8fb419423347486b77fa.js"></script>
                <p>
                    The Arduino code to handle this new command type can be seen
                    below.
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/sg758/7749a8e40ce9b0c5e36edafd4d4b386b.js"></script>
                <p>
                    Again, similar to the previous task, I sent each string
                    after only one pair of timestamp and temperature reading
                    to avoid going over the limit. Invoking the function caused
                    the following abridged output:
                </p>
                <figure id="figure6">
                    <img src="/ece4160-website/assets/images/lab2/tempRapid.jpg"
                        alt="5 seconds of rapid temperature data">
                </figure>

            <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>
                    If the board has 384 kB of RAM, this is equivalent to
                    3145728 b of memory, which is the exact value that is
                    displayed on the Arduino IDE output after flashing the board
                    with any sketch. Hence, assuming that the memory is not
                    occupied by anything else, exactly that much data can be
                    stored to send without running out of memory.

                    5 seconds of 16-bit values taken at 150 Hz would result
                    in 5 s x (150 times / 1 s) x (16 b) = 12000 b of data.
                    It would take 3145728 b / (12000 b / 5 s) = 1,310.72 s, or
                    approximately 21 minutes and 50 seconds to saturate the RAM
                    with data. Considering the task from above where a pair of
                    timestamp and temperature values were stored and sent, albeit
                    immediately, this is two values taken at some sampling
                    rate for a period of 5 seconds. If they were not sent
                    immediately after one pair of data, the RAM would saturate
                    much faster, causing major limitations.
