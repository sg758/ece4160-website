        <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                The purpose of Lab 4 was to add the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to the
                Artemis Nano robot system and be able to obtain accelerometer and
                gyroscope data of the robot, as well as solder a QWIIC cable to a 650mAh
                battery to allow the Artermis to be powered while on the robot.
            </p>

        <h1>Lab Tasks</h1>
            <h2>Setting Up the IMU</h2>
                <p>
                    The first task of the lab was to connect the IMU to the Artemis Nano
                    using the QWIIC cable, and run the
                    <samp>Example1_Basics.ino</samp>
                    example code to understand how the values of the sensors change as
                    the board is rotated around in all axes and accelerated. Figure 1
                    shows a picture of the connection of the IMU to the Artemis
                    using the breakout board.
                </p>
                <figure id="figure1">
                    <img src="/ece4160-website/assets/images/lab4/imuToArtemis.jpg"
                    alt="Connection of IMU to Artemis">
                </figure>

                <p>
                    After flashing the example code to the board, the Serial Monitor
                    produced the following output while keeping the IMU stationary and
                    on a flat surface:
                </p>
                <figure id="figure2">

                </figure>
                
                <p>
                    The example code defines various values including AD0_VAL. For the
                    SparkFun IMU breakout board, since the ADR jumper is open, the
                    value is set to 1.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After playing around with the IMU a bunch, Figure 3 shows the output
                    of the example code with +x axis facing down, +y axis facing up, and
                    finally while waving the board around, respectively.
                </p>
                <figure id="figure3" class="multiple">

                </figure>

            <h2>Accelerometer</h2>
                <p>
                    The accelerometer outputs the acceleration in the x, y, and z
                    directions. Using these values, the pitch and roll can be calculated
                    using these equations below:
                </p>
                    <p>Pitch = atan2(acc<sub>x</sub>, acc<sub>z</sub>)</p>
                    <p>Roll = atan2(acc<sub>y</sub>, acc<sub>z</sub>)</p>
                <p>
                    The images in Figure 4 below show the output of the pitch at -90°, 0°,
                    and 90°.
                </p>
                <figure id="figure4" class="multiple">
                    <img src="/ece4160-website/assets/images/lab4/neg90pitch.jpg"
                    alt="Sensor output with actual pitch of -90°">
                    <img src="/ece4160-website/assets/images/lab4/atrest.jpg"

                    alt="Sensor output with actual pitch of 90°">
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Similarly, Figure 5 shows the output of the roll at the same actual
                    angles.
                </p>
                <figure id="figure5" class="multiple">
                    <img src="/ece4160-website/assets/images/lab4/neg90roll.jpg"
                    alt="Sensor output with actual roll of -90°">
                    <img src="/ece4160-website/assets/images/lab4/atrest.jpg"
                    alt="Sensor output with actual roll of 0°">
                    <img src="/ece4160-website/assets/images/lab4/pos90roll.jpg"
                    alt="Sensor output with actual roll of 90°">
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Evidently, the values are relatively accurate. At worst, there was a
                    5% error, which was for the +90° roll.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To analyze the noise while obtaining sensor values when it is near an
                    operating RC car, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was performed. The
                    FFT takes a time-domain signal, and transforms it into a frequency
                    domain signal. Figure 6 shows both the time-domain and frequency
                    domain signal for the pitch while the Artemis and the connected IMU
                    was placed on top of a powered-on RC car.
                </p>
                <figure id="figure6" class="multiple">
                    <img src="/ece4160-website/assets/images/lab4/timePitch.jpg"
                    alt="Time-domain signal of pitch">
                    <img src="/ece4160-website/assets/images/lab4/FFTpitch.jpg"

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Evidently, there was a large amplitude for near-0Hz only, and so the
                    noise should not be a problem.
                </p>
                
            <h2>Gyroscope</h2>
                <p>
                    The gyroscope outputs the change in rotational direction along the x,
                    y, and z axes. Using these values, the pitch, roll, and yaw can be
                    found using these equations below:
                </p>
                    <p>Roll = Roll<sub>old</sub> + gyr<sub>x</sub> * dt</p>
                    <p>Pitch = Pitch<sub>old</sub> - gyr<sub>y</sub> * dt</p>
                    <p>Yaw = Yaw<sub>old</sub> - gyr<sub>z</sub> * dt</p>
                <p>
                    The images in Figure 4 below show the output of the pitch at -90°, 0°,
                    and 90°.
                </p>

            <h2>Sample Data</h2>
                <p>
                    To allow for the Artemis to send the IMU data over BLE while it is
                    strapped to the RC car, the updated Bluetooth code from
                    <a href="/ece4160-website/labs/lab3.html">Lab 3</a>
                    was updated again, by adding a way to trasmit the IMU data.
                    Effectively, the example code, as discussed earlier, was copied over
                    to the BLE code, adding new case statements and command types for
                    pitch and roll. These new cases can be seen in the snippets of code
                    below.
                </p>
                
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/sg758/074deba5735bbba63da69fd57f44fad1.js"></script>

                <script src="https://gist.github.com/sg758/d3a759aff5a55406cef647bca6ffe730.js"></script>
            
                <p>
                    Evidently, the pitch and roll is being stored in arrays of 5 at a
                    time, and being transmitted over BLE alongside the time stamp for
                    each. The plot in Figure 9 below demonstrates 5 seconds of the roll
                    data being sent over BLE, as the board was rotated approximately
                    between -90° and 90°.

            <h2>Cut the Cord!</h2>
                <p>
                    The next task of the lab was to solder a QWIIC cable to one of the
                    650mAh batteries. First, I cut off the wire sheathing of the black
                    and red wires, making sure to cut it one at a time. If I were to have
                    cut it both at once, a short would have been created with very little
                    resistance between + and -. Next, I soldered each of the wires to the
                    two wires of a QWIIC cable, ensuring that the polarity of the plug
                    matches the polarity of the battery. Finally, I applied heat to fit a
                    heat shrink over the point of soldering. The image in Figure 10 below
                    shows the final product.

            <h2>Stunt with RC Car</h2>
                <p>
                    The final task of the lab was to record a stunt on the RC car, while
                    having the Artemis and the connected IMU strapped to the car, so that
                    it can send the IMU data over BLE to the Jupyter Notebook for
                    analysis. However, before that, I first played around with the RC car
                    to discover all of the cool tricks that it can perform. The video in
                    Figure 11 shows the car going all over the place using the cyclone
                    mode.
